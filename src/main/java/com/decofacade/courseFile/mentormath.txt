Greatest Math course ever been.

Do you know that math is so easy and difficult at the same time? Like, a bunch of animals can count till 4 — for them, that’s already advanced calculus.
Flowers grow petals in Fibonacci sequences, planets move in ellipses described by Kepler’s equations, and even memes obey the laws of exponential decay.
In ZA WARUDO, everything that seems chaotic is actually ruled by numbers — you just have to look close enough.

[MENTOR NOTE]:

Remember, young mathematician — mathematics is not about memorizing formulas. It’s about seeing patterns in chaos and chaos in patterns.

In this course you will learn to understand math, not just to “do” it.
Let’s start simple.

+ means concatenation — it’s how small things grow into something bigger.
For example:

a is one

aa is two
So, a + a = aa, just as 1 + 1 = 2.

And * means multiplication — a form of repeated addition.
If you have 3 boxes, each containing 4 apples, you can express this as:
3 * 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

[MENTOR NOTE]:

The real secret of multiplication is that it’s just addition... done lazily by people who don’t like counting too much. Efficiency is intelligence.

TEST a

Solve: 192 + 8 = ?

a) 201
b) 199
c) 200
d) 202

[MENTOR NOTE]:

Don’t rush. It’s not about the answer, it’s about understanding why.
192 is near 200 — adding 8 brings it exactly to that round, beautiful number.
Think of numbers as distances on a line — sometimes it’s easier to “see” than to calculate.

[4];

Bla bla bla — ya ne pridumal.
Let’s imagine this section is about creativity in mathematics.
Even if you can’t think of an equation right now, the act of thinking mathematically is already valuable.
Because math is not about perfection — it’s about persistence.

[MENTOR NOTE]:

Every great mathematician once said: “I don’t know yet.”
And that “yet” is what makes progress happen.

END

[MENTOR FINAL NOTE]:

You have reached the end — but in mathematics, endings are illusions.
Every equation solved opens two more questions.
Keep asking. Keep solving. And remember:
“1 + 1 = 2” is simple… until you start asking why.

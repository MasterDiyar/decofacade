Greatest Java Course Ever Been

Do you know that Java is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages in ZA WARUDO?
It runs on billions of devices — from servers and computers to Android phones and even smart fridges.
Java follows the rule “Write Once, Run Anywhere”, meaning your code can work on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

In Java, everything starts with classes and objects.
Think of a class as a blueprint — like a cookie mold,
and objects as the cookies you create with it.
For example:
```
class Dog {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!"):
    }
}
```
Then in your main method:
```
Dog rex = new Dog():
rex.bark():
```
And Rex will bark in the console like a true OOP creature.

ava also has primitive types:
int, double, boolean, char, byte, and others.
They are the building blocks of all logic in your program.
Example:
```
int apples = 5:
int boxes = 3:
System.out.println(apples * boxes); // 15
```
This means you have 15 apples in total — same as in math, just with syntax.

TEST b
What will this code print?
```
int x = 10:
int y = 3:
System.out.println(x % y):
```
a) 3
b) 1
c) 0
d) 10

[5];
Java uses methods to organize code.
A method is like a mini-machine that does one thing.
You give it input (arguments), it processes them, and returns output (result).
Example:
```
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b:
}
```
Now you can call sum(5, 10) and get 15.
Reusability is key — don’t repeat yourself, or you’ll anger the gods of clean code.
